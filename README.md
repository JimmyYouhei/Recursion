# Recursion

##	Introduction 
This is my own algorithms that use Recursion to learn more about Recursion. 
##	Version: 
-	It is written by using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2019.1.3 x64
-	JDK version 11
##	How to install:
If you use IntelliJ IDEA use new -> Project From Version Control -> Git and paste https://github.com/JimmyYouhei/Recursion.git
##	How to use: 
-	Using the Main class to run any custom command (I have included some example command)
-	Recursion interface is fully written with method: 
    -	factorialHeadRecursion(int number): calculate the factorial of the number given and using head Recursion
    -	factorialTailRecursion(int number): like above but using tail Recursion
    -	printLinkedList(LinkedList<Integer> linkedList): print out all elements of an int Linked List
    -	printLinkedListReverse(LinkedList<Integer> linkedList): like above but in reverse order 
    -	greatestCommonDivisor(int number1 , int number2): Euclid greatest common divisor algorithm for 2 number given
    -	decimalToBinary(int decimal): convert the decimal number to a binary string 
    -	powerMethod(int base , int times): return the result of base^times
    -	printFibonacciSequence (int numberOfElement): print the Fibonacci Sequence that has total element fit the number given (exclude the “0”)
##	Note:
-	Due to the class is written purely for learning purpose so very little Exception handle is expected 
-	The project could use some JUnit tests, but I was too lazy to write them due to Recursion took a lot of my brain power already so will update later
-	Except for the Fibonacci Sequence , all was written originally by me . However, Recursion is hard and I could not claim I have taken a good understanding of it. However I must move on due to the time constraint 
-	The project originally plans to include the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. However, I could not have a good understanding of it so will try to include it later
